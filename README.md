# Executive Summary: Digit Recognizer Deployment for Automated Check Scanning

## Introduction

Metropolitan Bank processes over 100,000 paper checks daily. The current manual system for entering check amounts is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. To address these challenges, a machine learning-based digit recognizer has been developed and integrated into an automated check scanner system.

## Business Problem

### Manual System Drawbacks:
* 2-3 minutes per check processing time
* 2% error rate
* $2M annual labor cost
* Significant delays for customers

### Solution Requirements:
* Automated handwriting recognition
* Processing checks within 5 seconds
* 99.9% accuracy
* Low-confidence prediction flagging
* Robustness to diverse handwriting styles

## Expected Business Impact

* 90% reduction in processing time
* $1.8M annual savings
* Enhanced customer satisfaction
* Reduced error correction costs
* Reallocation of clerical staff to strategic tasks

## Model Development

### Training Data

The dataset comprises 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The training data has 785 columns, with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.

### Model Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Conversion of images to tensors
2. **Model Architecture:** Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)
3. **Training and Validation Split:** 80-20 stratified division
4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy and loss curves

## Results

### Training Performance

* **Loss Curve:** Rapid initial decrease, stabilizing with minor fluctuations
* **Accuracy Curve:** Early improvement, reaching over 98% by epoch 5, gradually approaching 100%

### Validation Performance

#### Confusion Matrix Analysis:
* High diagonal density indicates strong performance
* Few misclassifications scattered off-diagonal

#### Metrics:
* Validation Loss: 0.1570
* Validation Accuracy: 98.02%

### Prediction Summary

| Class | True Predictions | Misclassifications |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 0 | 807 | 16 |
| 1 | 967 | 12 |
| 2 | 789 | 22 |
| 3 | 860 | 15 |
| 4 | 799 | 11 |
| 5 | 735 | 19 |
| 6 | 783 | 17 |
| 7 | 834 | 23 |
| 8 | 815 | 15 |
| 9 | 845 | 21 |
| **Total** | **8334** | **171** |

### Conclusion

The digit recognizer achieves the desired accuracy and efficiency, significantly improving operational workflows while saving costs.

## Proposed High Level Design: Auto Check Scanner 

The proposed end-to-end auto check scanner workflow will include the following components with Digit Recognizer as its core component:

## 1. Check Capture 
* Physical checks are scanned at branch locations or ATMs
* Initial quality control ensures image clarity
* Multiple checks can be batch processed

## 2. Image Preprocessor
* Enhances image quality (contrast, alignment)
* Detects relevant fields (amount, account number)
* Removes background noise and artifacts

## 3. Digit Recognizer
* Neural network processes isolated digits
* Recognizes handwritten and printed numbers
* Provides confidence scores for each prediction

## 4. Banking System Integrator
* Validates recognized amounts
* Creates transaction records
* Updates account balances
* Archives check images for compliance

## Digit Recognizer: Component Deployment Guidelines

1. **Model Packaging:** Save the trained model as a serialized object
2. **Integration:** Incorporate the model into the bank's Auto Check Scanner application
3. **API Development:** Build FAST APIs to connect with existing systems
4. **Infrastructure Setup:** Use cloud deployment based on the bank's requirements
5. **Monitoring:** Implement logging and alerting for model drift, performance, and prediction errors

## Auto Check Scanner: Release Guidelines and Launch Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
* Processing Time: <5 seconds per check
* Accuracy: 99.9%
* Confidence Flagging Rate: <5%

### Monitoring Metrics:
* Real-time latency
* Error rate trends
* Customer satisfaction scores post-launch

### Release Phases:
* **Pilot:** Roll out to select branches for testing
* **Feedback Loop:** Address issues and refine the system
* **Full Launch:** Deploy across all branches

## Conclusion
With proper deployment and monitoring, the Auto Check Scanner with the Digit Recognizer is expected to transform check processing at Metropolitan Bank, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

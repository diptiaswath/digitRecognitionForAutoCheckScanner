# Digit Recognizer for Automated Check Scanning

## Executive Summary

Metropolitan Bank processes over 100,000 paper checks daily. The current manual system for entering check amounts is time-consuming, error-prone, and costly. To address these challenges, a machine learning-based digit recognizer has been developed and integrated into an automated check scanner system.

## Business Problem

### Manual System Drawbacks:
* 2-3 minutes per check processing time
* 2% error rate
* $2M annual labor cost
* Significant delays for customers

### Solution Requirements:
* Automated handwriting recognition
* Processing checks within 5 seconds
* 99.9% accuracy
* Low-confidence prediction flagging
* Robustness to diverse handwriting styles

## Expected Business Impact

* 90% reduction in processing time
* $1.8M annual savings
* Enhanced customer satisfaction
* Reduced error correction costs
* Reallocation of clerical staff to strategic tasks

## System Architecture: Auto Check Scanner

### 1. Check Capture 
* Physical checks are scanned at branch locations or ATMs
* Initial quality control ensures image clarity
* Multiple checks can be batch processed

### 2. Image Preprocessor
* Enhances image quality (contrast, alignment)
* Detects relevant fields (amount, account number)
* Removes background noise and artifacts

### 3. Digit Recognizer
* Neural network processes isolated digits
* Recognizes handwritten and printed numbers
* Provides confidence scores for each prediction

### 4. Banking System Integrator
* Validates recognized amounts
* Creates transaction records
* Updates account balances
* Archives check images for compliance
